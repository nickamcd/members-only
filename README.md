# README

This is an application with a publicly visible chatroom. Users can sign in to make posts and can see the authors of other posts while they are signed in. Users who are not signed in may read the posts, but the author of the posts remains anonymous.

This is an application made following the curriculum at www.theodinproject.com

This was used to practice user authentication through the use of the Devise rubygem.

TODO: style the page to be appealing to look at.
